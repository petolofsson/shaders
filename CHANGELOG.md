## 2026-05-10

- **R145 zone strength coupled to inverse grade slope** (`grade.fx`) — Zone S-curve strength automatically scales by `1/slope`: high tonemapper compression (already restored by R144 luma expansion) reduces zone contrast contribution; uncompressed content (slope≈1) gets full zone strength. ZONE_STRENGTH knob rescaled: 1.0 = calibrated default (internally ×0.30), 0 = off, 2.0 = aggressive. Both creative_values.fx updated to 1.00.
- **R144 luma inverse tonemapping** (`inverse_grade.fx`) — Extends R90 to expand Oklab L alongside C using the same IQR-derived slope, restoring the joint luma+chroma signal the game's tonemapper compressed. Pivot is `cbrt(p50_linear)` (not raw p50_linear) — Oklab L is perceptual/cube-root, so using linear p50 as pivot would place the zero-crossing at L≈0.50 (linear Y≈0.125, deep shadow). c_weight excluded from luma_factor: tonemapper compressed every pixel's luma equally including near-neutrals. mid_weight bell gate preserves L=0 and L=1 exactly. +5 lines to InverseGradePS. INVERSE_STRENGTH retuned 0.50→0.40 (joint expansion is stronger than chroma-only).
- **R143 reverted** (`inverse_grade.fx`) — Highlight reconstruction removed. Caused sun desaturation: near-clip warm light sources have Oklab C≈0.05 which falls below any viable C gate. Problem it targeted (orange clipping artifacts) is already resolved by R138/R130/R133. R90 mid_weight gate (≈0 at high L) also means near-clip pixels are barely touched by expansion — pre-correction was solving a non-issue.

- **R142 ColorTransformPS stage split** (`grade.fx`) — F4-A implemented. `BuildSceneCtx()` collects all scene-uniform texture fetches + derived scalars into a `SceneCtx` struct (~35 lines). `ApplyCorrective()` owns EXPOSURE→FilmCurve→halation→print stock→dye matrix→bleach bypass→3-way CC (~25 lines). `ApplyTonal()` owns zone S-curve→Retinex→shadow lift→R62/R65→R66 tint, returns `TonalOut {lin, new_luma, local_var}` (~55 lines). `ApplyChroma()` owns HELMLAB→Purkinje→R22→R133→R21→chroma lift→memory colors→HK→Abney→induction→density→gamut (~80 lines). ColorTransformPS becomes a 47-line orchestrator calling the three stages. Zero output change — compiler inlines all helpers.
- **`code_rules.md` → `CODE_RULES.md`** — renamed to match uppercase convention of other root docs.
- **R139 code rules audit — low/medium items resolved** (`all effect files`) — All remaining R139 open items closed: F4-B/C/D/E/F (function-length refactors: ScopePS→DrawLumaPost/Pre/HuePanel, UpdateHistoryPS→ComputeZoneStats/ComputeSlowKey/UpdateChromaKalman, DiffusionPS→ApplyDiffusionBloom+ApplyFilmGrain, ScopeCapturePS→CaptureLumaHistPixel+CaptureHueHistPixel, MeanChromaPS→ComputeMedianC); F5-B/C (bounds: P_new saturated, RGBtoOklab clamps input); F6-A (lms_illum_norm declared inline); F7-A/B (HueBandWeight self-defending frac(hue), GetBandCenter clamped); F1-B (conditional→lerp/step). F4-A (MegaPass) and F1-A (if-ladder) deferred; F6-B and F10-C documented as intentional/note-only.

## 2026-05-09

- **R139 common.fxh migration** (`general/common.fxh`, all effect files) — Consolidated 6 duplicate utility functions into a shared header: `PostProcessVS`, `Luma`, `RGBtoOklab`, `OklabToRGB`, `OklabHueNorm`, `RGBtoHSV`. `GetBandCenter` (Oklab 6-band) moved to `hue_bands.fxh` alongside its constants. `analysis_frame.fx` HSV-space variants renamed `GetHSVBandCenter`/`HSVBandWeight` to distinguish from Oklab counterparts. Resolves F8-A/B/C, F10-A, F2-A, F5-A from the R139 audit.

- **R137 print stock shoulder** (`grade.fx R51`) — Additive `−ps⁶×0.06` correction on the original `1−(1−ps)²×1.8` formula. Preserves shadow/midtone character exactly (ps⁶≈0 below 0.70); progressively compresses highlights above 0.75 (ps=0.85: 0.960→0.937, ps=0.90: 0.982→0.950). Reinhard partial (R134) reverted — it lost midtone body punch. R137 is a targeted correction, not a formula replacement.
- **R136 film grain** (`grade.fx DiffusionPS`) — Selwyn 2383 granularity model. pcg3d hash gives three fully decorrelated RGB noise streams per pixel. Amplitude envelope `σ = GRAIN_STRENGTH × 0.018 × sqrt(1 − L_gamma)` peaks at Oklab L≈0.50 (upper shadows), falls toward black and highlight extremes. Channel ratios R:G:B = 1.00:0.80:1.50. Framerate-independent: `grain_slot = uint(FRAME_COUNT × (FRAME_TIME/41.667))` — ~24fps turnover at any display fps. Zero new passes. `GRAIN_STRENGTH 0.0` (off, awaiting calibration).
- **creative_values.fx reordered** (arc_raiders + gzw) — Sections ordered by tuning frequency: EXPOSURE → ZONE → SHADOW_LIFT → 3-WAY CC → CHROMA → PRINT_STOCK → BLEACH_BYPASS → DIFFUSION → GRAIN → HALATION → MUNSELL → PURKINJE → INVERSE → HUE_ROT → CAMERA_RANGE → FILM_CURVE → COUPLERS → STAGE_GATES. gzw: MUNSELL_HIGHLIGHT_ROLLOFF added (was missing).
- **Shadow lift gate** (`grade.fx`) — `lift_w` ceiling 0.27→0.25→0.20. Lift now gates off at L=0.20, leaving lower mids untouched.
- **Bleach bypass highlight floor fixed** (`grade.fx`) — Lowered `lerp(0.35, 0.72, bb_dark)` floor 0.35→0.05. Physical bypass has near-zero effect in highlights.
- **R22 highlight arm removed** (`grade.fx`) — Removed `−0.45×saturate((L−0.75)/0.25)`. Superseded by R133.

## 2026-05-08

- **R133 Munsell per-hue highlight chroma rolloff** (`hue_bands.fxh`, `grade.fx`) — Replaces R74 linear ramp (`0.30*sat((L−0.80)/0.20)`) which had a hard gate at L=0.80 and never reached C=0 at L=1.0. New form: `f=(4(1-L))^n` per hue, f=1 at L≤0.75, f=0 at L=1.0. Twelve per-hue exponents in `hue_bands.fxh` from Munsell Renotation V=8→9→10 C_max ratios: yellow n=0.22 (peaks at V=9 — late onset), yellow-green n=0.27 (slowest), orange n=0.81 (fastest). `MUNSELL_HIGHLIGHT_ROLLOFF` knob added to `creative_values.fx`.
- **R132 polydisperse chromatic scatter** (`grade.fx DiffusionPS`) — `float3 ch_scatter = float3(1.15, 1.00, 0.85)` applied to both shimmer and midtone overlay. Red scatters more broadly, blue less — polydisperse filter media physics. DIFFUSION_STRENGTH 1.2 → 1.0.
- **R52 Purkinje improved** (`grade.fx`) — Added a* component toward 507nm blue-green (rod peak, not pure blue). Added scotopic desaturation `lab.yz *= 1 − 0.12 × scotopic_w × PURKINJE_STRENGTH` — rods are achromatic.
- **R131 HBM Gaussian blur** (`grade.fx`) — Replaced mip-based shimmer with separable 9-tap Gaussian chain (DiffusionDownsample → DiffusionBlurH → DiffusionBlurV → Diffusion). DiffusionTex 1/8→1/4-res; MipLevels 3→1. Grade now 8 passes.
- **R130 Kodak 2383 dye matrix** (`grade.fx`) — Replaced Beer-Lambert proxy + empirical coupling with 3×3 matrix from H-1-2383t spectral dye density data. R85 empirical values were 2–4× too high; corrected. Four absent cross-channel terms added.
- **Shadow lift audit** (`grade.fx`) — detail_protect widened `smoothstep(-0.5, 0.0)` → `(-2.0, -0.5)`; local_range_att removed (scene-wide gate redundant vs. per-pixel gates); lift_w ceiling 0.25 → 0.27.
- **CAT16 removed** (`grade.fx`) — Display-referred content; CAT16 was cooling deliberate warm lighting. NeutralIllumTex + lms_illum_norm kept for chromatic floor and ambient tint.
- **Chroma lift pivot fixed** (`corrective.fx`) — MIN_WEIGHT removed; weight now chroma-gated via `smoothstep(0.03, 0.08, C)`. Chroma lift was silently inert before this fix.
- **Diffusion radial oval** (`grade.fx`) — Replaced circular radial with `length(float2(c.x * 1.6, c.y * 0.08))`. Full clarity top-to-bottom; diffusion increases left/right.

## 2026-05-07

- **R124B NeutralIllumPS** (`grade.fx`) — New pass: 144-sample neutral-pixel-weighted illuminant estimate (16×9 grid, Oklab C-weighted). Replaces grey world mean for R83 chromatic floor and R66 ambient tint.
- **R126 FilmCurve body S** (`grade.fx`) — Linear body replaced with one-sided S: `max(0, (x*(1-x))²*(2x-1))*0.65`. Shadows untouched; upper mids peak +1.2% at x≈0.72.
- **R125/R126 Bezold-Brücke** (`grade.fx`) — Anchor fixed to h=0.25 (unique yellow) / h=0.75 (unique blue). Three-harmonic model gives correct teal > orange asymmetry (1.6×, per Kurtenbach 1994).
- **Zone_std thresholds recalibrated** — Intra-zone variance peaks ~0.15, not ~0.25+. Smoothstep bounds tightened.

## 2026-05-06

- **R113 mip fix** (`grade.fx`) — Cross-technique mip generation bug: CreativeLowFreqTex mip1/mip2 were zero everywhere. Fix: LFDownscale1 + LFDownscale2 explicit downscale passes within OlofssonianColorGrade.
- **R114 halation chromatic** (`grade.fx`) — Added blue component via Lorentzian attenuation. Gains `float3(1.05, 0.50, 0.0)` → `float3(1.05, 0.45, 0.03)`. White surfaces now produce correct orange/amber fringe.
- **R115 diffusion shimmer** (`grade.fx`) — Changed symmetric lerp to additive `base + max(0, blurred − base) * strength`. Previous model muted shadows; new model adds only from highlights.
- **R116 pipeline audit** — 9 issues resolved: chroma ceiling order, HWY_SLOPE minimum, adaptive CAT16 blend, chroma median → CDF p50, pure global percentiles, zone log key linear mean, intra-zone pixel variance, Bezold-Brücke anchor, R119 fine-texture gate.
- **LCA / R81A permanently removed** — No viable solution without a UI mask.
- **VIEWING_SURROUND / R76B removed** — Outside environment not pipeline's responsibility.

## 2026-05-05

- **R101 F1 Bezold-Brücke** (`grade.fx`) — `−sin(2π(h − 0.27))` unique-yellow-anchored model replaces uniform hue-by-luminance lerp. Reuses HELMLAB sincos — zero new trig.
- **R101 F2 H-K scene-adaptation** (`grade.fx`) — Fixed exponent 0.587 → `lerp(0.52, 0.64, saturate(zone_log_key / 0.50))`. Dim scenes get stronger H-K effect.
- **R101 F3 Abney C_stim** (`grade.fx`) — Coefficients now scale by pre-lift stimulus chroma (Burns et al. 1984). Zero ALU change.
- **OPT-1/2/3/4** — Eliminated third sincos (small-angle approx); tex2D → tex2Dlod for 4 reads in ColorTransformPS; removed dead `lin_pre_tonal` register and `CORRECTIVE_STRENGTH` lerp.
